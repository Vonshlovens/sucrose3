# SugarCube

SugarCube, or sucrose³ will be an app for users to learn and share knowledge.

## Knowledge Bootstrap - Ray Peat

A future vision of the app includes a knowledge-base that is heavily shaped by the community, but initially the app will be bootstrapped by my own collection of data, which focuses on key primary sources from Raymond Peat, along with many other people's and data sources as well.

## Knowledge Algorithm

Alternatively, or as a future implementation, develop an algorithm that starts with a set of people/communities and builds its own social network web using deep research and LLMs to create its own knowledge graph.

### Programmatic Approaches

In order to achieve more deterministic outcomes, could use actual social media platforms (X, instagram) APIs to check common connections, and find content for the knowledge graph (potentially using further deep research runs, LLM calls, etc.)
